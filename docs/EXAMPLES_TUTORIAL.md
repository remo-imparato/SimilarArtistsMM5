## Tutorial: Creating Your First Mood Playlist

### Scenario 1: Energetic Workout Mix (Seed-Aware)

**Goal**: Create an energetic workout playlist based on your favorite rock artists.

**Steps**:

1. **Select Seed Tracks**:
   - In MediaMonkey, navigate to your library
   - Select 3-5 tracks from artists you like for workouts
   - Example: AC/DC, Metallica, Foo Fighters tracks

2. **Configure Settings (optional)**:
   - In Tools → Options → Similar Artists, set a balanced blend ratio so results mix your taste with workout characteristics
   - Adjust similar artists limit, tracks per artist and max playlist size to control variety and length

3. **Generate Playlist**:
   - Run a Mood/Activity playlist using the "workout" activity option in the add-on UI

4. **Result**:
   - A mix of artists similar to your seeds plus workout-optimized picks, assembled into the playlist size you configured

### Scenario 2: Relaxed Study Session (Pure Mood)

**Goal**: Discover new relaxing music for studying, regardless of current listening.

**Steps**:

1. **Configure for Pure Mood Discovery**:
   - In the add-on settings, set the blend ratio to favour the mood (pure mood = low seed influence)
   - Choose the `focused` or `relaxed` mood and reduce tracks-per-artist if you want a concise list

2. **Generate Playlist** (no need to select tracks):
   - Run the Mood playlist for the chosen mood from the UI

3. **Result**:
   - A list of focus-friendly or relaxed tracks chosen for the mood, independent of your current library selection

### Scenario 3: Happy Mood in Your Style (Heavily Seed-Based)

**Goal**: Happy, uplifting music similar to what you're currently enjoying.

**Steps**:

1. **Select Current Favorites**:
   - Select 5–10 tracks you're loving right now (indie pop/rock works well for this example)

2. **Configure for Seed-Heavy**:
   - Set the blend ratio to favour your seeds (higher percent seed influence)
   - Optionally enable including seed artist results

3. **Generate Playlist**:
   - Run the Mood playlist for the `happy` mood from the UI

4. **Result**:
   - A playlist that closely matches your style but filtered to emphasise happy characteristics

## Blend Ratio Experiments

### Finding Your Sweet Spot

Try different ratios to see what works best:

- High seed influence (0.7–0.9): mostly your taste with subtle mood filtering
- Balanced (0.4–0.6): mix of familiar and new — a good starting point
- Low seed influence (0.2–0.3): mostly mood/activity-driven discovery
- Pure mood (0.0): ignore seeds and rely entirely on mood/activity characteristics

## Advanced Workflows

### Workflow 1: Progressive Discovery

Gradually discover new music while maintaining your taste:

- Week 1: Safe exploration (higher seed influence)
- Week 2: Moderate exploration (balanced)
- Week 3: Heavier exploration (lower seed influence)

### Workflow 2: Multi-Mood Day Planner

Create playlists for different times of day:

- Morning: Energetic wake-up
- Afternoon: Focus/work playlist
- Evening: Relaxation playlist
- Night: Sleep/ambient

### Workflow 3: Genre Deep-Dive

Explore a genre with mood variations:

- Select multiple artists from the genre then run mood variations to create several themed playlists

## Tips for Best Results

### Seed Selection Tips

1. Quality over Quantity: 3–5 well-chosen tracks are better than many random ones
2. Consistency: Select tracks from a similar style for cohesive results
3. Diversity: Mix several artists within a genre for broader recommendations
4. Recency: Use tracks you're currently enjoying for relevant playlists

### Blend Ratio Tips

- Safe exploration: 0.7–0.8 — your style with subtle mood
- Balanced: 0.4–0.6 — a good middle ground
- Adventure: 0.2–0.3 — mostly new discoveries
- Pure discovery: 0.0 — ignore seeds completely

### Mood/Activity Selection Tips

- energetic — Best with rock, metal, electronic
- relaxed — Works with many genres
- happy — Pop and upbeat genres
- sad — Singer-songwriter and melancholic styles
- focused — Instrumental, ambient, and classical

## Troubleshooting Examples

### Problem: Results too random

**Solution**: Increase seed influence (raise blend ratio) and select more consistent seeds

### Problem: Results too similar to seeds

**Solution**: Decrease blend ratio to introduce more mood/activity-driven picks

### Problem: Not enough tracks

**Solution**: Increase similar artists limit and tracks-per-artist in settings; expand max playlist size

### Problem: Wrong mood feel

**Solutions**:
- Try a different mood
- Check seed selection
- Adjust blend ratio

## Tips for Best Results

(Repeated tips; keep for convenience.)

- Start with a small tight seed set (3–5 tracks)
- Use balanced blend ratios for predictable variety
- Tune discovery limits for speed vs variety

---

## Next Steps

1. Experiment with different blend ratios and modes
2. Save playlists you like and note which settings produced them
